 Song Title: 7. Poser
 Lyrics: 
how does it feel to be a poser like you?
how does it feel to listen to limp bizkit ?

have you ever noticed that the word loser rhymes with poser?
and you don't know the title of the first manowar album

poser, you stand alone in the dark
poser, I wonder why noah put you in the ark
and you don't know the difference between Metallica and iron maiden
poser, you have the t-shirt of Reload

I am a poser, and I listen to korn
but I am not a loser and I'm glad to be born

even if you say that the word poser rhymes with loser that doesn't mean I am.....
well maybe I am a loser but I am always a human being!!

poser, you stand alone in the dark (I am just sleeping in my bedroom)
poser, I wonder why put you in the ark (because I smell less than the cercopitecosaurus)
and you don't know the difference between
Bruce Dickinson and blaze bayley (I wash my teeth every morning)
poser, you like virtual XI (ehm, and then?)

 Song Title: 6. Emerald Fork
 Lyrics: 
I hate the big mac which tastes like rat
the double cheese burger which made me much fat
now I'm in the cesso to expell all this shit
la cacarell m'ha fritt le budell
che cazzo me so magnato?

In the toasts of macdonald the meat was pure shit
no more meat of shit
and beaf steaks for all!

I've made a green shit, my poor lonely ass
now looks like bin laden and smells like his cat
now inside the cesso I vomit myself
fuck you big mac, fuck you bin laden, I scorregg on you!!

For the food, for the cook , for the kitchen, for the apples with the worm inside
for the hunger the thirst, to eat the black pork
I will search for the emerald fork!

Only a black pork with ketchup inside
I don't want a pink pork with hairs on his ass
Yes, I am a racist with porks and big mac
I eat the pork, bin laden can't because he's a Muslim

 Song Title: 11. Lung Of Steel (The Ballad Of True Metal)
 Lyrics: 
We were a little invidious of Manowar's diseases
Who made them have a heart of steel
We wanted to be more true than them
So we chose to get lung-cancer
So a surgeon would remove our meat-lung
And replace it with one made of steel

The operation went all-right
And we were so excited to have such true-metal
New organ inside ourselves
So we took our metal tricycles
And we stayed about all night outside for party
At least till 11 o'clock

Manowar were born with a heart of steel
But we will die with a lung of true metal

We cannot swim or take a bath
If we go to the airport the gate rings
If we meet someone who has a bypass
Our lung goes down
If we switch off the amps (we must stop breathing because otherwise our lung would explode,
but finally we are super-true!!)

Manowar were born with a heart of steel
But we will die with a lung of true metal

 Song Title: 10. Our True Metal Will Win
 Lyrics: 
We are so true that
Many people swear on us
Rather than on the bible
We are true
Because we eat more spinaches
(Which contain much iron)

We fight the posers
Because they are not true
And Manowar
Because they play gay metal
With electro-funk influences

Our true metal will win
Our true metal will win
Our true metal will win
Our true metal will win

Yesterday we have seen a poser
He was so poser that
He wore a Manowar t-shirt
But we were more true than him
And so he died of cancer

Our true metal will win
Our true metal will win
Our true metal will win
Our true metal will win

 Song Title: 9. (True) Metal Fart
 Lyrics: 
Casually I had three tons of beans in the kitchen
And I ate them all without thinking of the terrible consequences
I could not avoid the meltdown of my ass
Some greeny-brownish dense gases spread all around

Our asses are bleeding steel
Some gases will burn and kill
Our asses do not resist
The gases spread like a mist

After a week appeared a rainbow of arbre magique
In the clouds of green shit that brought happiness and metal-joy

Our asses are bleeding steel
Some gases will burn and kill
Our asses do not resist
The gases spread like a mist

Fell the smell, metal fart, taste the smell, metal fart
Prooooooootttttttttt

 Lyrics: 
Our metallicity coefficent is too high to be measured
When we see a poser we make him taste the steelness of our dicks
Our iron anus is pressured so that we can shot shit
Everytime we see someone that listens to false metal

False metal fuck you
Poser fuck you

We have the right to say false metal go fuck you
As long as we are too true metal to be true

Our grandfather was like us, he fought for the truth
And for the true swing and the true twist and shout
So we keep his spirit on and we fight for the true metal
Even if his music can be considered at the maximum as wood

False metal fuck you
Poser fuck you

We have the right to say false metal go fuck you
As long as we are too true metal to be true

 Lyrics: 
[This is a joke made up of a literal translation of Metallica's "Enter Sandman", it's pretty hard to make some sense of it in English.]

Di' le tue preghiere piccolino, non scordarti mio figlio di includere ognuno
Croccante fuori, morbido dentro, tieniti libero dal peccato, che arriva l'uomo di Sabbia

Dormi con un occhio aperto, attaccati forte al cuscino

Uscita luce, entrata notte, prendi la mia mano
Con la pasta del capitano

Qualcosa sbagliato, spegni la luce, pensieri pesanti stanotte e non si tratta di biancaneve
Sogni di guerra, sogni di pace, sogni di pollo alla brace, e di cose che mordono

Dormi con il culo scoperto, attaccati forte al cuscino

Stai zitto piccolino non dire una parola. E non badare a quel rumore che hai sentito.
E' solo una bestia dentro al tuo letto, nella tua testa nel tuo cassetto!

ESPLOSIONE!

 Song Title: 10. The Number Of The Bitch
 Lyrics: 
Forgive me, oh mum and dad
For the telecom sent the bill with wrath,
But I believed that the call was short
Let him who hasn't a girlfriend
Go and call the number of the bitch
Even if it is an expensive number, this number is 166 166 166

I was alone, I took the phone,
I needed time to think the number I saw on tv
Who did I hear! can I believe
A pack of horny lesbians howling back at me
I've always thought, I've always dreamed
Of magic whores to come and perform sodomy
'Cos in my dreams, it's always there
One dirty slut who takes my dick orgasming to despair

Night was black and I wanted to fuck
I've passed all night to see, Rocco's films on tv
In Netherlands the whores are close at hand
But in Italy, they're pretty hard to see

166 the number of the bitch
Hot chat line is going on tonight

You can go on, 'till the end of the road
You just have to be aware, shemales who hide out there
In the night, cars' lights are flashing bright
Bitch-hunting has begun, sexual work is done!

166 the numer of the bitch
30 euro the price for you and me

Pigs and gays, and everyone who says
" I am too arrapate, to stop to masturbate"
Take the phone, order some whores at home
They come to... make it rise and melt it down like ice

166 the number of the bitch
144 the number of the whore

To a sexy shop, I will return
And I will get more videos and hotter stuff of porn
I have the programs on pay TV
I have the hands to make libido take its course

Brothers of the power, true metal of the kings
Ride the king of metal, true power of the brothers

Power's still with us, we'll never fall!!

Steel of hell is holy and we like ham very much
But ham and steel is better, for lunch and for sinner
Battle for the power of the kings of the dinner!

Kill for the true metal screaming loud!

It's me, again, DJ-ames Bond, you are listening to Radio Graphy, on the Police radio frequency!
Today I feel like crushing your ears with the mighty Nanowar!
...much better than Fiorella Mannoia!
Fiorella Mannoia is an italian pop singer, whose name sounds pretty much like "M'Annoia", which means "It's Boring", so her name could be translated with "Fiorella Boring"
Did I say 'Boring'? No, she's not just boring, she really is a pain in my ass!
Oh, by the way don't forget that masturbation is a narcisistic and self-indulgent activity...
Got it?
Hold it tight!]

 Song Title: 2. Tricycles Of Steel
 Lyrics: 
It's made up of steel, but it's not a motorcycle
It's made up of wheels, but it's not a motorcycle
It's made up of kings, but it's not a motorcycle
It's made of True Metal, it is a fucking tricycle!!

Kings metal power true steel Oh yeah!
Nanowar'll always be there!

Tricycles of steel! Trycicles of steel!
Pollution is low, no fuel to go
We ride the the tricycles of steel!
WE RIDE THE TRICYCLES OF STEEL!!

Din din, the bell rings, our tricycles are for kings
(They run just like they had unicorn wings)
Din din, the bell plays, our ticycles are for gays
(Because there's no saddle where our ass lays)

 Song Title: 18. Christmas With Nanowar
 Lyrics: 
Merry Christmas with Nanowar,
It's the Christmas song of steel
Take this present from Nanowar (Of Steel)

Happy new year with Nanowar,
It's the merry happy new year song of steel
Join the gay dragon's party (of Iron)

Build a snowman with Nanowar,
And shape him like Rob Halford
Be careful, and put the carrot on the right side!

No more sadness with Nanowar,
Just look at our Christmas balls
They're hanging from our trees... eheh...
How allusive are we!

[Chorus:]
Santa Claus has come for all,
To the wall we nail our sock
And he puts in it his big fat Christmas cock
Fills the posers with the coal,
Gives true metal to us all
And the power of the power of the sword!

He is Santa Claus! This is Santa Claus!
Gifts of steel Santa Claus!
Deadly trees Santa Claus!

 Song Title: 15. Fight The Dragon (For The Village)
 Lyrics: 
Fire he spits and the paesants he ate,
Escape the elevator before it's too late
The dragon is evil but not very fat
It's uglier the dwarf in Rhapsody booklet (*)

"The dragon is dangerous" told uncle Griefus
when yesterday morning we met in the bus
The light of my sword now is shining so bright
The dragon is big, but I have the might

[Bridge:]
Drago, dragone con lo spadone io ti ucciderooo
Io ti kill you !

[Chorus:]
Lalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalala - Fight the dragon!
Lalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalala - For the village!

[Spoken Interlude:]
[Hero:] Dragon, you're evil, bad, bad and evil !
[Dragon:] No!
[Hero:] Yes!
[Dragon:] Yes!
[Hero:] NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

One day I saw the crowd walking there side by side
"Rebellion" I thought.. - NO it was the gay pride!!
We fight in the night for the knight of the light
The last words in rhyme are just might fright and sight

[Bridge:]
Drago, dragone brutto cafone, non ti vogliamo piuu
Non ti want you!

[Chorus:]
Lalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalala - Fight the dragon !
Lalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalala - For the village!

[Spoken Interlude:]
[Hero:] Dragon, your time is o'clock !
[Dragon:] No, I am the most invincible dragon of this song!
Ahahahhaa ahaha aaaaa aaaaa aaaaaa Pilade!!!

 Lyrics: 
So, the hero went to the Nanowar and got his sword.
On his way back to the village of Roccadipapamord he once again stopped to the wise one...
[Hero:] "Holy Wise One, I have the sword!"

[Hero:] "The dragon is big... but I have the might!"

 Song Title: 13. T.K.D.Y.N.S. (To Kill The Dragon You Need A Sword)
 Lyrics: 
To kill a Dragon, you need a sword
To make a sword, you need the iron
To make the iron you need a cave
To make a cave, you need a mountain
To make a mountain, you need a kingdom
To make a kingdom you need a King
And King is a song of Nanowar

To kill a dragon, you need a sword
To make a sword, you need the iron
To make the iron you need a cave
To make a cave, you need a mountain
To make a mountain, you need a kingdom
To make a kingdom you need a King
And King is a song of Nanowar !

 Song Title: 12. Tragic Beginning
 Lyrics: 
Once upon a time, in the ancient empire of Vibovalentiagard, near the sacred realm of Staropolis in the frogotten kingdom of Parmacot on the holy mountain of Paraflur of the mystical forest of Mastergard, there, down the lost valley of Lostvalleyland was the peaceful village of Roccadipapamord.
In this village, everyone lived in peace and harmony with each other, elves and dwarfs, knights and wizards, queens and kings, watson and crick, Dawson and creek, wallace and grommit, bed and breakfast.
But one day, a terrible thing happened.... an evil bad, bad, bad, bad, bad and evil dragon came there, to bring death and other bad things...
Only one man could kill him "I can kill him !"
But he didn't know how to kill him "I don't know how to kill him"
So, he went to the Wise One to ask him how to kill a big bad dragon....
[Hero:] "Holy Wise One, I beg you, how can I kill a bad bad bad bad bad dragon?"
[Wise One:] "My young son, a bad bad bad bad bad dragon, is very bad !"
[Hero:] "Yes ! But how can I kill him"
[Wise One:] "To kill a dragon... well it's easy, to kill a dragon you need a sword!"
